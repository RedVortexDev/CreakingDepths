# Creaking Depths

Tries to make the pale garden a bit harder.

Feel free to make pull requests or issues if you have any ideas or bugs.

## Features
- Adds thicker fog to the pale garden
- Allows the Creaking to move within that fog, even when looked at
- When a Creaking attacks, it snaps the player's neck, ignoring armor
- Attempts to make the Creaking immediately stop when looked at, instead of still sliding for a bit
- Adds a new gamerule: `doCreakingSpawning`
